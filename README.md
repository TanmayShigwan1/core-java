Java Exercises Workspace

This repository contains several small Java practice programs organized into folders:

- `condi_loops/` - condition and loop exercises
- `JavaBasics/` - basic syntax and data type examples
- `JavaQues/` - small problem solutions (fibonacci, reverse, swap, etc.)

How to run

1. Compile a file:
   javac path\to\FileName.java
2. Run it:
   java package.or.path.FileName

Example (from workspace root):
   javac JavaQues/fibo.java
   java JavaQues.fibo

Streak-wise plan

I can add a "streak-wise" structure if you want — two options:

1) Repo structure for daily practice: folders like `day-01`, `day-02`, etc., where you add one or more Java files per day.
2) A small Java program that tracks your coding streak (stores dates and computes current streak).

Tell me which option you prefer (1 or 2) or describe something else and I'll implement it.

Next steps performed

- Created this README.md and a Java-centric .gitignore.
- I'll initialize git and make an initial commit locally if you confirm.

How I can push to GitHub

- You can create an empty repo on GitHub and give me the repo URL; I'll add it as `origin` and push.
- Or, if you have the GitHub CLI (`gh`) logged in on this machine I can create the remote for you — tell me the desired repo name and whether it should be public/private.

If you'd like me to proceed and push now, say "push" and provide the repo name/visibility or the remote URL. Otherwise say how you'd like the "streak-wise" feature implemented.
